# Hospital-Management-using-Priority-Queue

Concept:-
We implemented the project using Priority Queue. Priority Queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure but where additionally each element has a priority with following properties.
1) Every item has a priority associated with it.
2) An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
3) If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
A Priority Queue is not quite the same as a just normal queue, in light of the fact that as opposed to being a "first-in-first-out", values turn out all together by priority. It is a theoretical information type that catches the possibility of a holder whose elements have "priorities" connected to them. A element of most astounding priority dependably shows up at the front of the queue. On the off chance that that element is deleted, the following most astounding priority element advances to the front of the queue.
